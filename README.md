# CrossFeed

This project is a social network app for crossfiters.

The aim is to expand the tight crossfit community thanks to the internet by being able to post recently completed WODs and PRs.

Based on the sharing of performance, the app automatically compares your PRs to the rest of the community in order to guage your levelof fitness and to identify your strenghts and weaknesses.
